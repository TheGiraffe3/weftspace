# Test Data

All the test data in this directory is structured a specific way on purpose. If copyright headers are missing, this is probably intentional. If unnecessary comments or bad syntax are present, generally they should be kept that way. Some lines may have trailing whitespace, this is also usually part of the test.

All this to say: if you think you've found a bug with one of the test data files, please check with me before trying to fix it, because there's a good chance it isn't a bug at all.

Regardless of the presence or absence of copyright headers, assume that all data in these files remains under the AGPL 3+ license.
