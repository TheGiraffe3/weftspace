# Weftspace

Weftspace is the library which makes developing Endless Sky tools easy. As well as providing read/write functionality for Endless Sky's data syntax, it also provides support for handling the data you've parsed and converting it to other data types.

Weftspace is currently available as a library for both Java and Python, although it is implemented slightly differently for each language. There are plans in place to provide NodeJS support as well.

For installation and usage instructions, see the README inside the directory corresponding to the language you wish to use.
