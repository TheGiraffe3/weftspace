# ESDF Manager
ESDF Manager is a Java library designed to provide the maximum possible level of support for Endless Sky datafile syntax. As well as providing read/write functionality through the DataReader and DataWriter classes, it provides support for handling the data nodes themselves.

ESDF Manager is currently in public beta. As far as I am aware, it is fully functional, but documentation is lacking and edge cases may cause unexpected errors. Any and all feedback, stress testing, and constructive criticism is much appreciated.
