# Weftspace

Weftspace is the library which makes developing Endless Sky tools easy. As well as providing read/write functionality for Endless Sky's data syntax, it also provides support for handling the data you've parsed and converting it to other data types.

Weftspace is currently available as a Java library, and there are plans in place to provide Python and NodeJS support as well.

Please see the [README for the Java library](java/README.md) for installation and usage instructions.
